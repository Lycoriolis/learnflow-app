# Exercise System Implementation Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for completing the exercise system in the LearnFlow application. Building on our recent improvements to the routing system, this plan focuses on enhancing the exercise content management, rendering, and progress tracking.

## 1. Exercise Data Model Enhancement

### Content Structure
- **Exercise Types**:
  - Multiple-choice questions with single or multiple correct answers
  - Coding exercises with test cases and evaluation
  - Written/essay exercises with rubric-based evaluation
  - Interactive exercises (drag-and-drop, matching, etc.)

- **Metadata Schema**:
  ```typescript
  interface ExerciseMetadata {
    id: string;
    slug: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    type: 'multiple-choice' | 'coding' | 'written' | 'interactive';
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    tags: string[];
    estimatedTime: string; // e.g., "5 min", "15 min"
    prerequisites?: string[]; // IDs of prerequisite exercises
    category: string;
    subcategory?: string;
    created: string; // ISO date string
    updated: string; // ISO date string
    author?: string;
  }
  ```

### Type-Specific Metadata
- **Multiple Choice**:
  ```typescript
  interface MultipleChoiceMetadata extends ExerciseMetadata {
    type: 'multiple-choice';
    allowMultipleSelections: boolean;
    options: {
      id: string;
      text: string;
      isCorrect: boolean;
      explanation?: string;
    }[];
  }
  ```

- **Coding**:
  ```typescript
  interface CodingExerciseMetadata extends ExerciseMetadata {
    type: 'coding';
    language: string;
    boilerplate?: string;
    testCases: {
      id: string;
      input: string;
      expectedOutput: string;
      description: string;
      isHidden?: boolean;
    }[];
    hints?: string[];
  }
  ```

- **Written**:
  ```typescript
  interface WrittenExerciseMetadata extends ExerciseMetadata {
    type: 'written';
    wordLimit?: number;
    rubric?: {
      id: string;
      criterion: string;
      description: string;
      maxPoints: number;
    }[];
  }
  ```

## 2. Content Loading and Management

### Content Organization
- Organize exercise content in `/static/content/exercises/[category]/[slug].md`
- Support both flat organization and nested categories
- Implement auto-discovery of exercise content

### Content Loading Service
- Enhance `enhancedContentService.ts` with:
  - `listExerciseCategories()`: Get all available categories
  - `listExercisesByCategory(category)`: Get exercises in a category
  - `getExercisesByTags(tags[])`: Find exercises with matching tags
  - `getRelatedExercises(exerciseId)`: Find exercises related to the given one

### Content Cache
- Implement a client-side cache for recently viewed exercises
- Add cache invalidation mechanism based on timestamps
- Implement prefetching of related exercises

## 3. Exercise UI Components

### Exercise Hub Page (`/exercises/+page.svelte`)
- Filter panel with:
  - Category selection
  - Tag selection
  - Difficulty filter
  - Completion status filter (all, completed, in-progress, not started)
- Sorting options:
  - Newest first
  - Trending/popular
  - Recommended for you
- Exercise cards with:
  - Visual indicator for exercise type
  - Difficulty badge
  - Completion status
  - Estimated time
  - Progress indicator

### Exercise Detail Page (`/exercises/[slug]/+page.svelte`)
- Common components:
  - Exercise header with metadata
  - Prerequisites section
  - Instructions section
  - Exercise-specific interaction area
  - Feedback/hint system
  - Submission controls
  - Progress tracking
  - Related exercises
  - Learning path suggestions

- Type-specific components:
  - `MultipleChoiceExercise.svelte`: Options selection with validation
  - `CodingExercise.svelte`: Code editor with execution environment
  - `WrittenExercise.svelte`: Rich text editor with word count
  - `InteractiveExercise.svelte`: Specialized interactive elements

## 4. Progress Tracking System

### Progress Data Model
```typescript
interface ExerciseProgress {
  exerciseId: string;
  userId: string;
  started: boolean;
  completed: boolean;
  attempts: number;
  lastAttemptAt: string;
  startedAt: string;
  completedAt?: string;
  score?: number;
  timeSpent?: number; // in seconds
  answers?: any; // type depends on the exercise type
  notes?: string;
}
```

### Progress Service Enhancements
- `updateExerciseProgress(exerciseId, data)`: Update progress for an exercise
- `resetExerciseProgress(exerciseId)`: Reset progress for an exercise
- `getExerciseProgress(exerciseId)`: Get progress for a specific exercise
- `getCompletedExercises()`: Get all completed exercises
- `getExercisesByStatus(status)`: Get exercises by completion status
- `calculateCompletionStats()`: Get overall completion statistics

### Progress Visualization
- Progress bars in exercise cards
- Detailed progress view in user dashboard
- Completion certificates for exercise sets
- Achievement badges for milestones

## 5. Exercise Interaction and Feedback

### User Interactions
- Save progress automatically
- Support for partial completions
- Resume from last position
- Draft saving for written exercises
- Code auto-save for coding exercises

### Feedback Mechanisms
- Immediate feedback for multiple-choice exercises
- Test case feedback for coding exercises
- AI-assisted feedback suggestions for written exercises
- Hint system based on common mistakes

### Gamification Elements
- Streak tracking for daily exercise completion
- Points system based on difficulty and performance
- Achievement badges for different accomplishments
- Leaderboards for exercise categories

## 6. Testing Strategy

### Component Tests
- Test each exercise type component independently
- Verify correct rendering of exercise content
- Test user interactions and validation logic
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### Integration Tests
- Test content loading and rendering pipeline
- Verify progress tracking accuracy
- Test navigation between related exercises

### User Experience Tests
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Test keyboard navigation
- Ensure screen reader compatibility

## 8. Open Questions & Decisions

- Should we implement server-side grading for coding exercises, or use a client-side solution?
- How should we handle exercise versioning when content is updated?
- Should we implement collaborative exercise solving features?
- How can we integrate AI-assisted feedback for complex exercise types?
- What metrics should we track to measure exercise effectiveness?
