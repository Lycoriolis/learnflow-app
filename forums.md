# Forums Page Documentation

## Overview
The Forums page provides a space for users to discuss topics, ask questions, and interact with the community. It supports topic creation, filtering, and browsing.

## Data Loading
- Forum topics and categories are loaded from the backend using services in `src/lib/services/forumService.ts` and server endpoints in `src/routes/forums/`.
- The page uses Svelte's reactivity and lifecycle functions to fetch and display forum data.

## Features
- Users can browse topics, filter by category or difficulty, and search for specific discussions.
- Authenticated users can create new topics and reply to existing ones.
- Each topic displays metadata such as author, creation date, views, and tags.
- The sidebar provides quick access to categories, stats, and learning resources.

## Customization
- The forums UI is built with reusable Svelte components under `src/lib/components/forums/`.
- You can extend forum features by updating the service layer or adding new endpoints in the API routes.

## File Location
- Main implementation: `src/routes/forums/+page.svelte`
- Forum services: `src/lib/services/forumService.ts`
- API endpoints: `src/routes/api/forum/`
