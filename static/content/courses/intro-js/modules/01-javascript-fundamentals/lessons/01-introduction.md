# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily known for its role in web development. Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was at Netscape, JavaScript has evolved from a simple scripting language to a powerful tool used for both client-side and server-side development.

## History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich in May 1995. Initially called "Mocha," then "LiveScript," it was eventually renamed "JavaScript" as a marketing decision to capitalize on the popularity of Java, although the two languages have very different syntax and design.

## Why Learn JavaScript?

1. **Ubiquity**: JavaScript runs in every web browser, making it the most accessible programming language in the world.

2. **Versatility**: Beyond front-end web development, JavaScript can be used for:
   - Server-side development (Node.js)
   - Mobile app development (React Native, Ionic)
   - Desktop applications (Electron)
   - Game development
   - Internet of Things (IoT)

3. **Job Market**: JavaScript developers are consistently in high demand.

4. **Community and Ecosystem**: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.

## JavaScript Today

Modern JavaScript (often called ECMAScript or ES6+) has introduced many powerful features that make the language more expressive and developer-friendly:

- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring assignment
- Promises and async/await
- Classes
- Modules

## Getting Started

To follow along with this course, you don't need to install anything special - just a web browser and a text editor. You can write JavaScript directly in your browser's developer console, or use online code editors like CodePen or JSFiddle.

In the next lesson, we'll dive into variables and how to store and manipulate data in JavaScript.
