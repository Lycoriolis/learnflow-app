# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It allows you to add interactivity to web pages, create dynamic content, and build full-fledged web applications.

## A Brief History

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was initially called "Mocha," then changed to "LiveScript," and finally named "JavaScript" as a marketing decision to capitalize on the popularity of Java (although the two languages have very different syntax and use cases).

The language was standardized in 1997 under the name ECMAScript, but "JavaScript" remains the common term for the language as it's implemented in browsers.

## Why JavaScript Matters

JavaScript has become the most widely used programming language for several reasons:

- **Ubiquity**: It runs in every web browser, making it universally accessible
- **Versatility**: It can be used for front-end and back-end development (Node.js)
- **Ecosystem**: It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
- **Community**: It has a large and active developer community

## JavaScript Today

Modern JavaScript has evolved significantly since its creation. The language now includes features like:

- Arrow functions
- Template literals
- Destructuring assignment
- Classes
- Modules
- Promises and async/await

These features have made JavaScript more powerful and developer-friendly.

## JavaScript vs. Java

Despite the similar names, JavaScript and Java are entirely different languages:

| JavaScript | Java |
|------------|------|
| Interpreted | Compiled |
| Dynamically typed | Statically typed |
| Prototype-based | Class-based |
| Functions as first-class objects | Functions tied to classes |
| Used primarily for web | Used for desktop, mobile, and enterprise |

## Try It Yourself

Here's a simple example of JavaScript code:

```javascript
// This is a comment
console.log("Hello, world!");

// Variables
let name = "JavaScript";
const year = 1995;

// A simple function
function greet(person) {
  return `Hello, ${person}!`;
}

// Using the function
console.log(greet(name));
```

In the next lesson, we'll explore how JavaScript is used in web browsers.
