# HTML Basics Exercise

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you'll practice creating a simple HTML webpage with various elements. This will help you understand the structure of HTML documents and how different elements work together.

## Requirements

Create an HTML document that includes:

1. A proper HTML document structure with `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags
2. A page title (in the head section)
3. Multiple heading levels (h1, h2, h3)
4. Paragraphs of text
5. A list (ordered or unordered)
6. At least one image (you can use a placeholder image from https://placeholder.com/)
7. A hyperlink to another website
8. Bold and italic text formatting
9. A simple table with at least 2 rows and 2 columns

## Starter Code

You can use this basic structure to get started:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Exercise Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    
</body>
</html>
```

## Expected Output

Your completed exercise should look something like this (though the specific content will be different):

![Example HTML page](https://example.com/path/to/example-image.jpg)

## Hints

- Use proper indentation to make your HTML more readable
- Remember to close all your tags
- Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate
- Validate your HTML using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
