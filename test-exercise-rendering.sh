echo ""
echo "📋 Key Improvements Made:"
echo "- Fixed excessive spacing between lines"
echo "- Proper spacing around mathematical expressions"
echo "- Enhanced exercise item structure and numbering"
echo "- Optimized typography for mathematical content"
echo "- Better responsive design for exercise content"
echo "- Improved accessibility and keyboard navigation"
echo "- Enhanced code block formatting"
echo "- Better system of equations rendering"
echo ""
echo "🔍 To verify improvements:"
echo "1. Navigate to any exercise with mathematical content"
echo "2. Check that exercise items are well-structured"
echo "3. Verify math expressions render without spacing issues"
echo "4. Ensure headers have proper visual hierarchy"
echo "5. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes"
